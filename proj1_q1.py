   Develop a Python program which compares 2 csv files and:
   -displays students (student ID) who exists in both courses
   -displays students (student ID) who dosn't exists in both courses

    Open 2 csv files for reading, by default will use file1 and file2,
    read the content as a list, create 2 new lists by appending the first

    Convert the lists to sets and apply sets methods.
